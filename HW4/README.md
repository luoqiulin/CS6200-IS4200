# CS6200/IS4200: Homework 4

After cloning this repository, you can edit the Jupyter notebooks locally or an a hosted platform like Google Colab. Read through the notebooks `embeddings.ipynb` and `document-reranking.ipynb`, filling in code and explanations in the blocks starting with "TODO". Note that `embeddings.ipynb` has some extra credit questions at the end.

Whenever you'd like to save your work, and when you are done, make sure to check in and push to GitHub (if working locally) or, in Colab, select "Save a copy to GitHub" in the File menu.
